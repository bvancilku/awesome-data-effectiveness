# Awesome Data Effectiveness

Communicating your data for the desired effect

Do you struggle with analyzing and communicating data to effect the changes you would like to see in the world? Do you have any approaches that work particularly well for your projects?

Welcome to a world in which other data professionals care about improving practice as much as you do! We invite you to join in a conversation and collective data collection experience about which data practices aid in maximizing effectiveness. _¡Vivan los datos efectivos!_

## Transformation

Does the layout of your data permit easy analysis? Sometimes the transformation of the data will depend on the specific purpose. Can your data be transformed readily?

### Data quality and missing data

## Communication and visualization

Do the visualizations communicate in a way that facilitates decisions?

## Feedback

Have you designed systems so that errors in data are noted and can inform future practice?

## Reproducibility

Will anyone else be able to carry out your analysis in your absence? Will you be able to carry out your own analysis again in 3 months?

### R

* [Drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) is a build system in R for data science projects. It ensures that you only have to run the steps that changed.
* [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) provides local reproducible package environments for R similar to those that exist in other languages. Ensure that your colleagues or future you will be running the same versions of all your packages!
